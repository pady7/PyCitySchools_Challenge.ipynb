### Overview of the school district analysis: 


There was a grasp of information that we were able to conclude based off conducting this school district analysis. There were different subjects that were looked at by which the students study. There were different grade levels that the students study. There were different challenges that the students had to overcome with their curriculum.

### Results:


Using bulleted lists and images of Data Frames as support, address the following questions. o How is the district summary affected?
The district summary is affected by the fact that we determined their average score for reading and math. Those subjects were focused on upon the students throughout the district. Throughout the district the average math score was 78.9. The average reading score throughout was 81.9. The average passing math score was 74.8. The average passing reading was 85.7. Overall passing score was at 64.9.


* How is the school summary affected? The school summary was affected because it was focused in on just one specific school and their subjects. Also was focused in more on the differenced between a charter school vice vera a district school and the variables that play in between. Were the students able to learn or have a better outcome of success in their academic studies by conducting this study.


* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? By doing a replacement of the level of the ninth graders it affects the score of the subjects from Thomas High School because now it helped improve the students scores for them to be more successful. The average math and reading score is now at 83 percent passing score, which is an increase from the compartment of involving other scores.


* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:  Math and reading scores by grade- yes, by replacing the 9th grader scores with NaNs it makes the average of the other schools and grades be able to increase if there is NaNs factor in with other scores.  Scores by school spending- No, the amount that each school spends on a budget, has no affect with replacing the 9th graders scores.  Scores by school size- yes, the score by school size is a factor in because it is causing the sum of the average to go up or down factoring the total number that is populated by the percentage of the total.  Scores by school type- No, Thomas High School was a charter school. I don’t really think that district against charter school plays a whole factor in this because in comes down to the number of students in a class that replaces for the 9th graders. Perhaps in the fact that usually in a district you would have a bigger sum of 9th graders than you would for a Charter school.


### Summary: 

Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs. The four changes would be that one the average math score was 78.9% of the class. Two would be that the average reading score would be 81.9% of the class. Three would be 74.8% students passed math. Four would be that 85.7% students passed reading. This is the current updated status for the district analysis after the reading and math scores for the ninth grade were replaced with NaNs at the Thomas High School.
